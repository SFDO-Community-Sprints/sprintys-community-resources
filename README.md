# Sprinty's Community Resources

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
If you have ever heard the words “we can’t possibly be the first ones to ever encounter this!” followed by “well... how do other organizations do it?” then we have something just for you!

To enable non-profit organizations to do more with their Salesforce technology by offering nonprofit staff and consultants in an easy, searchable repository of our community’s best tips, resources and use cases. This will help Salesforce users and builders paint the possibilities of what they can do in their Salesforce org.

## Mini-Sprint (Octber 20, 2022)

### Project Team Accomplishments
We moved to our new home in a Salesforce Experience Site! We created a flow for resource submissions, started building out the curator process in the Experience Site, and added a table of resources to the site using Enhanced Lightning Grids. 

# Project Resources and Documentation
Documentation can be found in the repository [wiki] (URL for wiki where docs are stored)

# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Replace with the goals your team would like to continue working on next time.
