# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
If you have ever heard the words “we can’t possibly be the first ones to ever encounter this!” followed by “well... how do other organizations do it?” then we have something just for you!

To enable non-profit organizations to do more with their Salesforce technology by offering nonprofit staff and consultants in an easy, searchable repository of our community’s best tips, resources and use cases. This will help Salesforce users and builders paint the possibilities of what they can do in their Salesforce org.

## Sprint (DATE)

### Project Team Accomplishments
Please replace with the tasks you team was able to accomplish during the Sprint event.

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
